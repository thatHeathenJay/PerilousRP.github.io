                      All player reports must be submitted through our Discord
                      server. To report an incident or individual, open a ticket
                      in the '#open-ticket' channel with relevant information.
                      Community members should never directly contact
                      Administration or staff members. Hostile behavior towards
                      Staff through direct messages or tickets may result in a
                      ban, depending on severity. Staff will proactively enforce

                      reports.
